## What is IOT all about

The Internet of Things, or IoT, is a network of physical devices. These devices can transfer data to one another without human
intervention. IoT devices are not limited to computers or machinery. The Internet of Things can include anything with a sensor
that is assigned a unique identifier (UID). The primary goal of the IoT is to create self-reporting devices that can communicate
with each other (and users) in real time.
