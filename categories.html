## ACTIVITY 1- Digital Enterprise 

### What is a fully digital enterprise?
It is an organization that has integrated digital technology into all aspects of its operations, processes and functions.

### What are the cyber security challenges/ concerns with a fully digital enterprise?
The complexity of IT environments.
I.) Data breaches- There is a high risk of data breaches, due to the storage of large volumes of sensitive data. This is where the hackers come in.
II.) Phishing attacks such as tricky emails that may be sent to employees to trick them into giving away company secrets.
III.) Ransomware Attacks
IV.) IoT vulnerabilities and smart gadgets, with devices like cameras or sensors, hackers can use this as vulnerable points to get into the company’s network.
V.) cloud security and safety, if the cloud services where most businesses store their data on is not secure, their data might be at risk.
VI.) Trusted people, sometimes company employees might misuse their access to sensitive information either accidentally or on purpose.

### What are the cyber security challenges for a bricks and mortar SME wanting to become a digital enterprise?
I.) Limited money and people, most small businesses usually don’t have a lot of money or staff and buying the right tools to stay safe online can be tough.
II.) Not knowing enough (Lack of Knowledge and expertise), people in the business might not know a lot about online safety 
III.) Data protection 
IV.) Phishing attacks 
V.) outdated systems- These systems and softwares might not have the latest safety updates, which makes them easy targets for cyber attacks.
VI.) Third-party Risks- small and medium-sized enterprises often rely on third-party vendors for various services and if these vendors have weak cybersecurity, it can indirectly affect the SME’s security.
VII.) Mobile securities.

## ITEC442(Activity 2)- Scanning activity 


### How many hops from your machine to your assigned website?

   I recorded 14 hops.

### Which step causes the biggest delay in the route? What is the average duration of that delay?

   Step 14 caused the biggest delay with an RTT(round trip time) of 188ms, which is also considered   the average duration of the delay.

### What are the main nameservers for the website?

Server- dlinkrouter
Name Servers :
DNS1.P05.NSONE.NET
DNS2.P05.NSONE.NET
DNS3.P05.NSONE.NET
NS-1622.AWSDNS-10.CO.UK
NS-692.AWSDNS-22.NET


### Who is the registered contact?


### What is the MX record for the website?
Primary name server = ns-1622.awsdns-10.co.uk
Responsible mail address = awsdns-hostmaster.amazon.com
Serial = 1
Refresh = 7200 (2 hours)
Retry  = 900 (15 mins)
Expire = 1209600 (14 days)
Default TTL = 86400 (1 day)


### Where is the website hosted?


## Reflection on the activity

### Did you have any issues or challenges with the scans?
No I didn’t encounter any major challenges with the scans, my only problem was figuring out which command to use in some certain stages.

### How did you overcome them?
I did some research on commands to use for some specific tasks, and also went through my week 2 lecture notes and had a chat with chatgpt AI for some assistance as well.

### How will they affect your final report?
Positively I believe, with all the research assistance I got, I believe I was able to perform my scans accurately, and also answer the given questions in the exercise.
